 Changes between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2  [?? ??? 2011]

  *) Fixed issue n°1, some endian releted issue and removed dependency
     from libcrypto.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

 Changes between 0.1.0 and 0.1.1  [10 Jan 2011]

  *) Optimized support for integrated GPU.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Build process simplified.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Generic code cleanup, bug fixes and many optimizations.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Now encryption for AES CBC mode are computed by the cpu.
     Since the CBC mode needs the cipher texts of each previous step to
     process the next step, and so it isn't possible to begin the encryption
     of a block until its previous block has been encrypted, we can't hope
     to do parallel processing during the encryption stage of this mode.
     If you want you can re-enable it on the configure command line.

  *) Performance improvement from 6% to 12% depending from your hardware
     configuration.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

 First public release, 0.1.0  [26 Jul 2010]

  *) Optimized support for AES encryption and decryption for 128 bit, 
     192 bit and 256 bit key length with a fine-grained approach,
     the code is optimized for 32 bit operation.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Support for the ECB and CBC block cipher types.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Ability to keep T-table in constant memory or shared memory,
     the key and the rounds are kept in texture memory.
     All access in global memory are coalesced.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Support for the GNU/Linux operating system.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Many other things (simply all the rest).
