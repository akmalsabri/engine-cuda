 Changes between 0.1.0 and 0.1.1  [01 Nov 2010]

  *) Optimized support for integrated GPU.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Build process semplified.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Generic code cleanup and many optimizations.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Encryption for AES CBC mode now are computed by the cpu.
     Since the CBC mode needs the ciphertexts of each previous step to
     process the next step, and so it isn't possible to begin the encryption
     of a block until its previous block has been encrypted, we can't hope
     to do parallel processing during the encryption stage of this mode.
     If you want you can re-enable it on the configure command line.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Performance improvement from 5% to 30% depending from your hardware
     configuration.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

 First public release, 0.1.0  [26 Jul 2010]

  *) Optimized support for AES encryption and decryption for 128 bit, 
     192 bit and 256 bit key lenght with a fine-graned approach,
     the code is optimized for 32 bit operation.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Support for the ECB and CBC block cipher types.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Ability to keep T-table in constant memory or shared memory,
     the key and the rounds are keapt in texture memory.
     All access in global memory are coalesed.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Support for the GNU/Linux operating system.
     [Paolo Margara <paolo.margara@gmail.com>]

  *) Many other things (simply all the rest).
